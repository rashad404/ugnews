                            <h3>Personal identification information</h3>
                            We collect User information when you register on <?=$_PARTNER['website']?> website or app<br/>

                            <h3>How we collect the information</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    We may use various technologies to collect and store technical information about the activity on websites, such as cookies, pixel tags, log files,web beacons or similar technologies. This information is anonymous and de-identified. We cannot use such data for the purpose of tracking or profiling any user. For your convenience, below you can find a general explanation about some of the technologies that we may use:<br/>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><b>Pixel Tags:</b> A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website in combination with cookie to enable tracking activity on websites.</li><br/>
                                        <li><b>Web Beacon:</b> A web beacon is technique used to track who is reading a web page or email, when, and from which computer.</li><br/>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    <b>Mobile Device Opt-Out</b> - you may opt out of receiving targeted ads on mobile devices using the Android operating system, by using platform level controls enabled through your device settings. You should consult your device settings and instructions provided by your device manufacturer. However, we provide the following information solely for informational purposes.
                                    If you have an Apple device, you can opt out of targeted advertising by updating to iOS 6.0 or higher, and setting "Limit Ad Tracking" to "ON". You can do this by clicking on Settings -> Privacy -> Advertising, and toggling "Limit Ad Tracking" to "ON". This prevents apps that you use from using your Apple device’s Advertising Identifier to serve you targeted ads. In addition, or as an alternative, you may reset your device’s Advertising Identifier, which will result in your device being disassociated from ad targeting profiles based on the Advertising Identifier in effect prior to reset. You can do this by clicking on Settings -> Privacy -> Advertising -> Reset Advertising Identifier. Again, you should consult Apple’s support web pages and instructions for the most current applicable settings.
                                </li><br/>
                                <li>
                                    If you have an Android device, you can opt out of targeted advertising on your device. You can do this by clicking the menu icon to display the apps list, then find and select the Google Settings icon, then find and select "Ads" and check the box "Opt out of interest-based ads". In addition, or as an alternative, you may reset your device’s Android advertising ID, which will result in your device being disassociated from ad targeting profiles based on the Android advertising ID in effect prior to reset. You can do this by clicking the menu icon to display the apps list, then find and select the Google Settings icon, then find and select "Ads" and selecting "Reset advertising ID". Note that Android settings menus may vary among device manufacturers and these instructions may not be accurate for your device. You should consult Google’s settings and instructions for the most current settings information.
